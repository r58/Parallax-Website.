        <h2>CHICAGO RAIN</h2>
        <p>
            The climate of Chicago is classified as hot-summer humid continental (Köppen: Dfa). All four seasons are distinctly represented: Winters are cold and often see snow with below 0 Celsius temperatures and windchills, 
            while summers are warm and humid with temperatures being hotter inland, spring and fall bring bouts of both cool and warm weather and fairly sunny skies. Annual precipitation in Chicago is moderate and relatively evenly distributed, 
            the driest months being January[1] and February[2] and the wettest July[3] and August.[4] Chicago's weather is influenced during all four seasons by the nearby presence of Lake Michigan.

        <h2>CHICAGO BULIDINGS</h2>
        <p>
            Chicago is the birthplace of the skyscraper.[6][7] The Home Insurance Building, completed in 1885, is regarded as the world's first skyscraper. 
            This building used the steel-frame method, innovated in Chicago. It was originally built with 10 stories, an enormous height in the 1800s, 
            to a height of 138 feet (42 m). It was later expanded to 12 stories with a height of 180 feet (55 m). The building was demolished in 1931.
            [8][9] New York City then began building skyscrapers as Chicago had done, and the two cities were virtually the only cities in the world with huge skylines for many decades

        <h2> SAN FRANCISCO BRIDGE</h2>
        <p>
            The Golden Gate Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the Golden Gate, the one-mile-wide (1.6 km) strait connecting San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean. 
            The structure links the U.S. city of San Francisco, California—the northern tip of the San Francisco Peninsula—to Marin County, carrying both U.S. 
            Route 101 and California State Route 1 across the strait. It also carries pedestrian and bicycle traffic, and is designated as part of U.S. Bicycle Route 95. 
            Being declared one of the Wonders of the Modern World by the American Society of Civil Engineers,[7] the bridge is one of the most internationally recognized symbols of San Francisco and California. 
            It was initially designed by engineer Joseph Strauss in 1917.
